Have you had any previous medical issues?\\nPatient: No, I haven't.\\nDoctor: Alright, we'll need to run some tests to determine the cause of your chest pain. Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.\\nPatient: What's that?\\nDoctor: It's a type of heart attack that doesn't show up on an electrocardiogram. We'll need to do some imaging to confirm the diagnosis.\\nPatient: Okay, what's the next step?\\nDoctor: You'll need to be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. We may need to perform a percutaneous coronary intervention to open up any blockages in your blood vessels.\\nPatient: Alright.\\nDoctor: After your admission, you underwent the PCI procedure and everything seemed to go well. However, two days later you had persistent chest pain with hypotension and loss of consciousness, and we had to intubate you.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\\nDoctor: Imaging confirmed that you had a massive pulmonary embolism, so we administered reteplase to dissolve the blood clot.

Magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated findings of empty sella syndrome with no distortion of optic nerves or posterior aspect of the optic globe.\\nPatient: What does that mean?\\nDoctor: Empty sella syndrome is a condition where the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened, and the sella turcica (the bony structure that houses the pituitary gland) appears empty. We will need to do a fluoroscopic-guided lumbar puncture to measure your CSF pressure to exclude intracranial hypertension.\\nPatient: Okay, what are the results?\\nDoctor: The opening CSF pressure was 7 mmHg by fluid-coupled measurements and 15 cm of H20 by fluid column method. A total of 16 cc of clear CSF was removed. The final pressure was 3 mmHg by fluid-coupled measurements and 5 cm of H2O by fluid column method.\\nPatient: That sounds complicated.\\nDoctor: Your headache worsened after the procedure, which is a possible side effect.

After the procedure, you became hypotensive. Did you experience any other symptoms?\\nPatient: No, just feeling a bit dizzy.\\nDoctor: Okay.
